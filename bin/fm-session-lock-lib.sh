# Shared session-lock harness identity.
#
# ONE owner of the "which verified-harness process holds this home's session
# lock, and does the current process descend from that same harness?" decision.
# bin/fm-lock.sh uses it to acquire and inspect state/.lock;
# bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh uses it to prove a Stop hook fires inside the
# lock-owning primary session before it may arm or rewake.
# This file is sourced by scripts and has no side effects on source.

# Cursor process identity is NOT expressible as a command-name pattern and is
# deliberately not added to the tables below: Cursor's installed names are
# cursor-agent and the far-too-generic legacy alias `agent`, and it runs as a
# bundled node script. bin/fm-cursor-lib.sh is the fleet's single owner of that
# decision, so this file delegates to it rather than widening the name match.

#
# For every harness except Claude the innermost match is the session, which is
# where e.g. Pi's shared signed-wrapper ancestry actually holds the lock: a

# instead runs hooks several levels below the session inside its own nested
# worker chain (hook shell -> claude bg-spare -> claude bg-pty-host -> claude ->
